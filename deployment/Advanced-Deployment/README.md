# ðŸ“Œ Terraform Improvements & Best Practices

## âœ… Improvements & Benefits

### 1. **Sensitive Credentials Stored Securely**
- Instead of hardcoding passwords and usernames in `main.tf`, we define them in `variables.tf` and assign values in `terraform.tfvars`.
- This prevents credentials from being exposed in version control.

### 2. **Data Persistence**
- Added **Docker volumes** to retain data even if containers restart.
- This ensures that Grafana dashboards, Prometheus metrics, and InfluxDB data are not lost.

### 3. **Custom Docker Network**
- A dedicated network (`monitoring_network`) is created to isolate monitoring-related services.
- Improves **security** and prevents conflicts with other containers.

### 4. **Pinned Image Versions**
- Instead of using `latest`, we specify versions like `grafana/grafana:10.1.1`.
- Ensures **stability** and prevents unexpected behavior from upstream changes.

### 5. **Environment Variables for Configuration**
- Variables are used to manage credentials and storage paths efficiently.
- Makes the infrastructure more **scalable and manageable**.

# ðŸ“Œ Why Use `variables.tf` and `terraform.tfvars`?

### **1. `variables.tf` (Declaring Variables)**
- This file defines the variables that we use in `main.tf`.
- It helps make the Terraform script reusable and **prevents hardcoding sensitive values**.


### **2. `terraform.tfvars` (Providing Values)**
- This file stores **actual values** for the declared variables.
- It is **ignored in version control** to **protect sensitive information**.

# ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

âœ… **Terraform script is now more secure, scalable, and efficient.**
âœ… **Credentials are stored securely instead of being hardcoded.**
âœ… **Data persistence ensures no data loss after container restarts.**
âœ… **A dedicated network improves isolation and security.**
âœ… **Best practices make the Terraform code more reusable and maintainable.**

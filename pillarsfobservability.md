## The three pillars of observability are logs, metrics, and traces. These three data outputs provide different insights into the health and functions of systems in cloud and microservices environments.

**Logs** are the archival or historical records of system events and errors, which can be plain text, binary, or structured with metadata.

**Metrics** are numerical measurements of system performance and behavior, such as CPU usage, response time, or error rate. 

**Traces** are the representations of individual requests or transactions that flow through a system, which can help identify bottlenecks, dependencies, and root causes of issues.
